# speaker_reflections
Experimenting with idea of having a speaker calibrated to play inverted sound wave on delay to actively cancel out reflected noise off of a wall

# Original sound with no reflections:
![normal sound](video_saves/gif/original_no_reflections.gif)

# With reflections:
Bouncing off of wall at x=100<br>

# Only showing reflections within certain radius of reflection focal point:
Drawing original signal + reflected sound in areas within distance of 160 from reflection focal point<br>

# With source playing delayed signal in addition to signal:
Where source is emitting f(x) + f(x-9)<br>
(Seems to "reverse" in the area of the reflected sound)<br>

# With a speaker at focal point playing inverse of current source signal
Theoretical speaker would be behind the reflecting wall<br>
(Sound in the area of the reflection now matches original signal)<br>
